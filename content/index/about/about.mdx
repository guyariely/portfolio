import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

I’m a <Underlining>web developer</Underlining> and a 2nd year <Underlining>Computer Science student</Underlining>.

I love working and building for the JS ecosystem. I’m always interested in learning new
technologies and using them to <Underlining>create new, beautifully designed applications</Underlining>.

I choose to build for the web because the WebDev ecosystem and community <Underlining>is in my opinion like no other</Underlining>. It’s such a fruitful ground for innovation. New ideas and technologies are being adopted every day. It's an exciting place to be a part of.
